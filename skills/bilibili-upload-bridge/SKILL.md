# Bilibili Upload Bridge

## Role

Bridge Dasheng Publish channel packs to external B站 upload tools. Prefer `biliup-rs`; use `social-auto-upload` as fallback. Both are external dependencies, not vendored and not version-locked.

Default roots:

```bash
${BILIUP_RS_ROOT:-/Volumes/PSSD/biliup-rs}
${SOCIAL_AUTO_UPLOAD_ROOT:-/Volumes/PSSD/social-auto-upload}
```

## Inputs

- `channel_pack.json` for `bilibili_video`
- Final MP4
- Optional SRT/subtitle
- Title, description, tags, cover

## Workflow

1. Check upstream registry:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_publish_upstreams.py --name biliup-rs
   ```
2. Validate final video exists.
3. Build B站 submission package:
   - title
   - description
   - tags
   - cover
   - video path
   - subtitle path when present
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build_video_upload_package.py --channel-pack <channel_pack.json>
   ```
4. Prefer a dry-run or draft/upload preview when the external tool supports it.
5. Ask for explicit confirmation before real submission.
6. Write platform response, draft ID, URL, screenshot, or fallback reason back to the publish package.

## Fallback

If `biliup-rs` is missing, broken, or cannot authenticate:

1. Try `social-auto-upload-bridge` for Bilibili.
2. If that fails, export an人工投稿包 and mark status `manual_package`.

## Hard Rules

1. B站 uploads are not considered published until a URL,稿件 ID, or platform response is recovered and verified.
2. Do not store B站 cookies or account secrets inside this repo or `skills/`.
3. Do not mark `ready_for_execution` if the MP4 is missing.
4. If the account requires CAPTCHA/SMS/manual login, stop and request user action.
